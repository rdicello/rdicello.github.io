            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm R.J. DiCello. I'm a 20 year old music producer and
                computer programmer from Ohio. Right now, I'm a student at
                Berklee College of Music. I'm very grateful to be here, even
                though I almost wanted to leave a few months ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the last 2 years, I was torn between music and computer
                science. I knew I couldn't choose both, so I chose music,
                and buried computer science. I came to Berklee not sure of
                myself, so there were many times I felt miserable. I worked
                to create meaningful projects, even when I hated what I was
                doing. After 1.5 years, I couldn't handle the confusion, so
                I took a gap semester. I became a dairy associate, stacking
                dairy and frozen items on grocery store shelves. I remember
                looking at myself in the freezer's glass reflection, thinking
                about what I could be doing at school. It humbled me, making
                Berklee seem like vacation, and teaching me that I might as
                well work toward something that I resonate with, even in
                the slightest. My mind was clearer, realizing that I could
                go back to Berklee and try again with a different mindset.
                I would be grateful to learn, be positive, expressive,
                authentic, courageous, and original.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I'm finishing my committments at Berklee, majoring in
                Electronic Production and Design and minoring in Creative
                Coding, and learning about software development and computer
                science in my spare time. I have big plans for future projects,
                and I know that I want to carry my morals I listed above into
                everything I do.
